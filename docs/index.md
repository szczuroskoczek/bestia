# Welcome to BESTIA Documentation

BESTIA – **Backend Engine for Scalable, Transactional, Integrated Applications** – redefines backend development by merging database schema, migration logic, and application logic into one deployable unit.

## TL;DR

- **Unified File:** Combines immutable schema/logic (BESTIA Manifest) with dynamic data (snapshots, logs, indexes).
- **Multiple Environments:** Supports Node.js, Docker, serverless, IoT, and more.
- **Seamless Migrations:** Automatically evolves your schema while preserving data integrity.
- **Developer-First:** Utilizes TypeScript decorators for an intuitive coding experience.
